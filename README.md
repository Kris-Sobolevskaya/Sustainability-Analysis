# Vanilla Sustainability Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the sustainability metrics of vanilla production over time. The analysis explores key sustainability aspects, including **production volume**, **carbon emissions**, and **water usage**, with a focus on the environmental impacts of vanilla cultivation.

Using publicly available data, the goal of the project is to demonstrate how different sustainability metrics change over time and how various environmental factors are interconnected. This project is part of an effort to understand and visualize the impact of agricultural practices on the environment, particularly for crops like vanilla that have a significant environmental footprint.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available reports and datasets on vanilla production, with key metrics covering:

- **Production (tons)**: The amount of vanilla produced each year.
- **Emissions (kg CO₂e)**: The carbon emissions associated with the production of vanilla, measured in kilograms of CO₂ equivalent.
- **Water Usage (liters)**: The amount of water used during vanilla cultivation, measured in liters.

The dataset spans multiple years and provides insights into how each of these sustainability metrics has evolved over time.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preparation**: The raw data is cleaned, structured, and transformed into a format suitable for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: Key metrics are calculated and analyzed to identify trends, correlations, and insights regarding sustainability.
3. **Visualization**: Graphs and charts are generated to visually present the changes in production, emissions, and water usage over time.

### File Structure

- `vanilla_sustainability_summary.csv`: Contains the raw data on vanilla production, emissions, and water usage by year.
- `SustainabilityAnalysisVanilla.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis code, visualization, and summary data from the raw data.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

# Data Analysis
## Metrics Included:
### Production (tons): The yearly production of vanilla beans in tons.
- Emissions (kg CO₂e): The yearly carbon emissions associated with vanilla production, measured in kilograms of CO₂ equivalent.
- Water Usage (liters): The yearly water usage during the vanilla cultivation process, measured in liters.

# Insights & Trends:
The analysis will reveal trends in vanilla production over time and how environmental impacts (such as emissions and water usage) correlate with production levels.
The project aims to provide insights into how sustainable vanilla production can be, helping to inform better agricultural practices.
